Fall 2020
Project 2: Skip lists
Wed, Oct 7, 2020

Due: 11:59 PM, Sun, Oct 25 (elearning).

Ver 1.0: Initial description (Wed, Oct 7).

Project Description:

Implement the following operations of skip lists, following the
algorithms discussed in class. Starter code is provided.  A driver program is also provided.
Sample inputs and outputs will be provided.

Do not change the signatures of methods declared to be public.  
You can add additional fields, nested classes, and methods as needed.
Do not create additional source files.  Place all code in SkipList.java.


* add(x): Add a new element x to the list. If x already exists in
  the skip list, replace it and return false. Otherwise, insert x 
  into the skip list and return true.

* ceiling(x): Find smallest element that is greater or equal to x.

* contains(x): Does list contain x?

* first(): Return first element of list.

* floor(x): Find largest element that is less than or equal to x.

* get(n): Return element at index n of list.  First element is at 
  index 0.

* isEmpty(): Is the list empty?

* iterator(): Iterator for going through the elements of list in
  sorted order.

* last(): Return last element of list.

* remove(x): Remove x from the list. If successful, removed
  element is returned.  Otherwise, return null.

* size(): Return the number of elements in the list.

Submission Procedure

* Submit SkipList.java in elearning. 

* You can submit multiple number of time. Only the last
  submission will be considered.

* If you have worked with a partner, only one of you need to submit

* Include the group members name and netid in the source file
